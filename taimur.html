      <p>Hailing from Gaibandha, Sakina Khanam excelled academically, garnering scholarships that sustained her education until her post-doc. A setback in medical admissions led her to reluctantly accept admission at the Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh.Guided by skilled educators, her interest in agriculture blossomed. The way her mentors applied international knowledge to local agricultural research intrigued her.Sakina Khanam consistently requested to join the Plant Breeding Division at BINA, but it almost always had no vacancy. Despite having the right qualifications, there was a misconception that female researchers cannot visit the sites and hence conduct research on plant genetics properly without a hectic schedule. Sakina realized she had to prove herself further to break these barriers.</p>
